Hi!

 That's my Github that +/- represent my knowledge and skills that i aquired working on Microsoft Partners project
  where i was in team that is responsible for UI, Api, Multiplayer/Netcode, Accessibility issues and analyst of designs.
 As it was Game testing it's different - but not that much as many people thinks as it was not connected to gameplay tests but to api and UI.

   The most part of my work is in the NDA and a lot of Tech stack is internal created for purposes of our project 
   so for presentation of my knowledge i will use tech stack that is similar or which was used by me at work: 
     free API that is available here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com 
   postman to read and work on API and Jira for tasks and bug repository. 
     Please note: it's my first encounter with Github so it can lack of quality and as im using it for quality assurance - 
	 things like branches, c: 
   
   
   Usable links to fast copy:

   Jira:
